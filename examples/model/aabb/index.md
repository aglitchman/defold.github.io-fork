This example shows how to work with Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) in a 3D scene. The setup consists of falling cubes that are dynamically tracked by a camera using their combined bounding box. The example demonstrates:

* How to create and manage a dynamic bounding box that updates with moving objects
* Using `model.get_aabb()` to get object bounds
* Camera positioning based on bounding box size
* Dynamic object spawning with factory
* Smooth camera transitions

Press SPACE or click to spawn new cubes. The camera will automatically adjust to keep all objects in view based on their combined bounding box.
