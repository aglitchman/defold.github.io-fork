The setup consists of one `player` game object with a `model`, `camera` and `script` component. The `model` component uses "Knight.glb" and "knight_texture.png". The "Knight.glb" file contains meshes and animation data. The `player.script` is used to play different animations from "Knight.glb".

The model and assets are [made by Kay Lousberg](https://kaylousberg.com/game-assets/).
