		<h4>Theme: Secrets</h4>
		<p>The theme for the game jam is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secret" target="_blank">"Secrets"</a>. You must incorporate some aspect of the theme in your game. Perhaps some of the game mechanics are secret and has to be discovered while playing? Or there's a secret weaved into the story, waiting to be uncovered as the game is played? Or maybe the player will find secret treasures? Or something completely different. It is all up to you!</p>

		<h4>Web Monetization</h4>
		<p><a href="https://webmonetization.org/" target='_blank'>Web Monetization</a> is an open technology that allows someone viewing a webpage or playing a web game to stream very small payments (micropayments) to the creator in real time. It is an exciting new and non-intrusive way for game developers to monetize their web games while at the same time offering premium content to their paying players.</p>

		<p>Web Monetization is being <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-web-monetization-a-new-revenue-model-for-the-web/3785" target='_blank'>proposed as a W3C standard</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://interledger.org/" target='_blank'>Interledger</a> protocol which is an open, neutral protocol for transferring money of any currency, including digital currencies such as Bitcoin.</p>
