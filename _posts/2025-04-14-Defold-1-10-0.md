# Defold 1.10.0

### Box2D Version 3
This release includes an updated (optional) version of Box2D (version 3). We are working towards making it the default version, but there are some tasks left before that can happen.

Also note that while the integration has been built on top of the same data formats as before and should largely behave the same, please be aware that projects can potentially behave slightly differently now. According to the documentation, the new Box2D version is more or less a full rewrite of the physics engine, which means that some settings might need to be tweaked.

If you want to change to the new version you can change this by using an app manifest. To read more about app manifests, please have a look at [the app manifest documentation](https://defold.com/manuals/app-manifest/).

Known differences:

* Trigger vs Trigger collisions - The documentation in Box2D for Triggers (aka Sensor in Box2D terminology) mentions: *A sensor shape generates overlap events but never generates a collision response. Sensors do not collide with other sensors and do not have continuous collision.*
   * This means that the new version of Box2D will only generate `trigger_response` events on enter and exit with kinematic and dynamic objects. **Two triggers that overlap will not be detected**.

### Stricter `.defignore` pattern matching
We've updated the implementation of `.defignore` patterns to more strictly adhere to the rules stated in the documentation. Previously, a pattern like `/import` would naively match any path that starts with `/import`. This meant that if you added a file named `/important.json` to the project, it would be ignored. We've updated the rules to now only match the `/import` directory itself and anything below it.

## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#10337](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10337)) __'Update box2d to version 3'__ by Jhonnyg
Box2D has been updated to Version 3, which is now the default physics engine for 2D. Since the latest Box2D version is more or less a full re-write, using the new version might cause existing projects to simulate or behave differently. If you want to keep using the old physics implementation for your projects, you can switch to the old version by using an app manifest:

<img width="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11b31635-8d74-42d8-a7e0-e468fca05de3" />

To read more about app manifests, head over to https://defold.com/manuals/app-manifest/

Know differences from the previous version of Box2D used in Defold:

* Trigger vs Trigger collisions - The documentation in Box2D for Triggers (aka Sensor in Box2D terminology) mentions: *A sensor shape generates overlap events but never generates a collision response. Sensors do not collide with other sensors and do not have continuous collision.*
   * This means that the new version of Box2D will only generate `trigger_response` events on enter and exit with kinematic and dynamic objects. **Two triggers that overlap will not be detected**.

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#10240](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10240)) __'Add a wrapper api for our profiler properties'__ by JCash
If you are a native extension developer and are using the `DM_PROFILE()` macros, there has been an api change.

The changes needed to update should be minimal.

Previous:
```c++
DM_PROPERTY_PROPERTY_GROUP(rmtp_TestGroup1);
DM_PROPERTY_BOOL(rmtp_TestBOOL, 0, FrameReset, "", &rmtp_TestGroup1);
```

Now, we've added the parent as an explicit argument, and we've converted the enum into a Defold specific enum:
```c++
DM_PROPERTY_GROUP(prop_TestGroup1, "", 0); // excplicit parent pointer, 0 in this case
DM_PROPERTY_BOOL(prop_TestBOOL, 0, PROFILE_PROPERTY_FRAME_RESET, "", &prop_TestGroup1);
```

__NEW__: ([#10274](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10274)) __'Reduce the size of the `dmanifest` file in the build and in LiveUpdate'__ by AGulev
The `dmanifest` in the release bundle no longer contains the full project path to the file `url`, as this information is only needed for debugging. This reduces its size.

__NEW__: ([#10268](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10268)) __'Parallel native code building on Extender for different architectures'__ by AGulev
Now, Extender builds different architectures for the same platform simultaneously to speed up the build process.
For example, `armv7-android` and `arm64-android` or `js-web` and `wasm-web`.

__NEW__: ([#9983](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9983)) __'GPU skinning support'__ by Jhonnyg
Model components can now support GPU skinning when using materials with a "local" vertex space. There are now two new builtin model materials that can be used (`model_skinned` and `model_skinned_instanced`) that can support either instanced or non-instanced models. 

![ScreenRecording2025-03-03at09 54 141-ezgif com-cut (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73a58122-0694-49bb-8aab-fa637240c270)

The GPU skinning uses a `floating point texture` to store all the bones of each animation. This means that in order for this to work, `the client must have support for floating point textures`. This can potentially be an issue on WebGL1, but in generally floating point textures are extremely well supported so in most cases this will not be an issue.

__NEW__: ([#10284](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10284)) __'Add callbacks for progress and completed load'__ by smagnuso
Added two extra parameters to the [`CUSTOM_PARAMTERS` for HTML5 builds](https://defold.com/manuals/html5/#extra-parameters):

* `start_success` - Function that is called just before main is called upon successful load
* `update_progress` - Function that is called as progress is updated. Parameter progress is updated 0-100

__NEW__: ([#10123](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10123)) __'Create 3d textures via resource.create_texture'__ by Jhonnyg
The engine can now support 3D textures in runtime. Use these resource functions to work with 3D textures:

* resource.create_texture
* resource.create_texture_async
* resource.set_texture

Examples:
```lua
-- Create a 3D texture that can be used in a compute shader
local t_backing = resource.create_texture("/my_backing_texture.texturec", {
	type   = graphics.TEXTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_3D,
	width  = 32,
	height = 32,
	depth  = 32,
	format = resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA32F,
	flags  = resource.TEXTURE_USAGE_FLAG_STORAGE + resource.TEXTURE_USAGE_FLAG_SAMPLE,
})
```

```lua
-- create a buffer that can hold the data of a 8x8x8 texture
local tbuffer = buffer.create(8 * 8 * 8, { {name=hash("rgba"), type=buffer.VALUE_TYPE_FLOAT32, count=4} } )
local tstream = buffer.get_stream(tbuffer, hash("rgba"))

-- populate the buffer with some data
local index = 1
for z=1,8 do
    for y=1,8 do
        for x=1,8 do
            tstream[index + 0] = x
            tstream[index + 1] = y
            tstream[index + 2] = z
            tstream[index + 3] = 1.0
            index = index + 4
        end
    end
end

local t_args = {
    type   = graphics.TEXTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_3D,
    width  = 8,
    height = 8,
    depth  = 8,
    format = resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA32F
}
 
-- This expects that the texture resource "/my_3d_texture.texturec" already exists
-- and is a 3D texture resource. To create a dynamic 3D texture resource
-- use the "resource.create_texture" function.
resource.set_texture("/my_3d_texture.texturec", t_args, tbuffer)
```

__NEW__: ([#10355](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10355)) __'Use vulkan as default renderer on osx'__ by Jhonnyg
Vulkan is now the default renderer on OSX (x86_64-macos and ram64-macos).

Q: What are the benefits of using Vulkan?
A: Many! These are some typical points:

* OpenGL is deprecated on osx. This means that OpenGL can get fully removed from the mac ecosystem at any point in time.
* More new potential features (compute shaders are supported by default, among many other modern features)
* Improved rendering performance (mainly for 3D)
* You can profile the rendering in Xcode to get accurate timings for a frame
* In general reduced runtime memory footprint
* OpenGL is complete and will likely not get any more updates in the future. Using modern tech means we can add and improve rendering in the future.

Q: I don't want to use Vulkan, can I use OpenGL?
A: Yes, you can use an app manifest to switch back to OpenGL. Read more about app manifests here: https://defold.com/manuals/app-manifest/

__NEW__: ([#9984](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9984)) __'GL ES for the Linux ARM64 target to support running on Raspberry Pi and Linux handhelds'__ by aglitchman
This PR changes the graphics API from desktop OpenGL to OpenGL ES for the Linux ARM64 target. Devices on this platform usually do not have support for desktop OpenGL because they are built on mobile chips. Also added gamepad mapping for Linux handhelds to the gamepads database.

__NEW__: ([#10252](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10252)) __'Added new window API functions'__ by britzl
Added new window.* API functions:

```
window.set_size(width, height)
window.set_position(x, y)
window.set_title("Defold rocks!")
local scale = window.get_display_scale()
```

__FIX__: ([#10257](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10257)) __'Show Lua errors when building or bundling for HTML5'__ by AGulev
Fixed an issue where building or bundling for HTML5 ignored errors in Lua code.

__FIX__: ([#10269](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10269)) __'Make sure the LiveUpdate manifest is deterministic'__ by AGulev
Fix issues where `engine_versions` in the LiveUpdate manifest may have a different order from build to build.

__FIX__: ([#10254](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10254)) __'Take Bob’s parameters into consideration to decide which resources should be rebuilt'__ by AGulev
Now Bob knows which resources may be affected by its parameters and rebuilds only those resources. For example, if the first bundle is done with `--texture-compression` and the second bundle is done without it, all textures, atlases, and other related resources will be rebuilt.
This should improve the experience when bundling without the `clean` parameter for Bob.

__FIX__: ([#10300](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10300)) __'Output crosscompilation errors from pipeline'__ by Jhonnyg
Fixed an issue where some shaders can't be crosscompiled to a certain shader version.

__FIX__: ([#10175](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10175)) __'Update to latest vulkan + MoltenVK versions'__ by Jhonnyg
Vulkan has been updated to v1.4.307 and MoltenVK has been updated to use a special fork of MoltenVK that adds input attachment via programmable blending, which is a prerequisite for the Defold Rive integration.

__FIX__: ([#10313](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10313)) __'Create texture script regression'__ by Jhonnyg
Fixed an issue where dynamic texture resources where not created correctly on non-opengl graphics adapters due to a miscalculation of the data size parameter.

__FIX__: ([#10329](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10329)) __'Fix build time reporting to support multithreaded builds'__ by AGulev
Build time report now supports multithreaded Bob builds
![CleanShot 2025-03-11 at 18 12 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/025019a1-8b17-4c29-abe0-b29166fb7fe8)

__FIX__: ([#10267](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10267)) __'Async texture update support for vulkan'__ by Jhonnyg
The vulkan backend can now upload texture data in parallell.

__FIX__: ([#10351](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10351)) __'Merge shader resources'__ by Jhonnyg
Shader resources can now be merged between different stages of the same shader program:

my_shader.vp:
```glsl
uniform shared_uniforms {
    vec4 tint;
};
uniform sampler2D shared_texture;
void main()
{
    vec4 shared_color = texture(shared_texture, vec2(texcoord0));
    gl_Position = view_proj * vec4(position.xyz * tint.x + shared_color.r * 0.001, 1.0);
    var_texcoord0 = texcoord0;
}
```
my_shader.fp:
```glsl
uniform shared_uniforms {
    vec4 tint;
};
uniform sampler2D shared_texture;
void main()
{
    vec4 shared_color = texture(shared_texture, var_texcoord0.st);
    color = tint * shared_color;
    color.a = 1.0;
}
```

Previously, shared_uniforms and shared_texture would be used as two separate resources in the engine, which means that the same resource would be bound twice even though they are supposed to be used as a single resource.

Furthermore, the pipeline will now also make sure that outputs from a shader stage matches the inputs of the next shader stage (e.g vertex shader + fragment shader). Previously, this example would cause non-opengl adapters to behave incorrect:

my_shader.vp:
```glsl
out vec4 out_position;
out vec3 out_normal;
out vec2 out_uv;
```

my_shader.fp
```glsl
in vec3 out_normal;
in vec2 out_uv;
in vec4 out_position;
```

With the new remapping system, the locations of the outputs from the vertex shader will correctly match the inputs of the fragment shader.

Note: Remapping of resources will currently only work with the "new shader pipeline". To migrate your old shaders to the new pipeline, head over to https://defold.com/manuals/shader/#writing-modern-glsl-shaders to read more.

__FIX__: ([#10291](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10291)) __'Added profiler backend for HTML5'__ by JCash
We've added a new profiler backend that allows you to do in game profiling on HTML5 builds.

We also added a function `profiler.dump_frame()` that allows for logging the current frame to the output:
```
function update(self, dt)
    profiler.dump_frame() -- dump to output at the end of the frame
end
```

It will yield output like:

Dragging the labels of numeric properties now updates their value depending on the drag direction. When this action is supported, the label will be highlighted on mouse over, and the mouse cursor will switch to horizontal-resize. Left-right / up-down gestures both work. Some property types may override the default step (1), to a more sensible default. Holding `SHIFT` while dragging multiplies this step by 10, and holding `CTRL` divides it by 10, to allow different precision levels on a case by case basis.

__NEW__: ([#10357](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10357)) __'Projects can list paths to not load in .defunload'__ by matgis
You can now list files and resources to exclude when loading the project in a `.defunload` file below the project directory. This may be of interest to large projects that contain multiple independent modules, where excluding parts of it can reduce memory usage and load times in the editor.

Simply put, the `.defunload` file allows you to hide parts of the project from the editor without making it a build error to reference the hidden resources.

The patterns in `.defunload` use the same rules as the `.defignore` file. Unloaded Collections and Game Objects will behave as if they were empty when referenced by loaded resources. Other resources that match `.defunload` patterns will be in an unloaded state, and cannot be viewed in the editor. However, if a resource that is loaded depends on them, the unloaded resources and their dependencies are loaded automatically.

For example, if a Sprite depends on images in an Atlas, we have to load the Atlas, or the missing image will be reported as an error. If this happens, a notification will warn the user about the situation and provide information about which unloaded resource was referenced from where.

The editor will prevent the user from adding references to `.defunloaded` resources from loaded resources, so this situation only occurs when resources are read from disk.

__NEW__: ([#10253](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10253)) __'Introduce color dropper'__ by sprocketc
Display a color dropper button when we move the mouse over a color input field. For now, the dropper can only be used to capture pixel values within the editor.

__FIX__: ([#10266](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10266)) __'Improve parallel code loading on editor startup'__ by vlaaad
The editor is more reliable when loading its code on startup.

__FIX__: ([#10279](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10279)) __'Do not clean the bundle folder to speed up the bundling process'__ by AGulev
From now on, the bundle option in the editor does not clean the bundle folder (equivalent to the `distclean` option in Bob) to speed up bundling.

__FIX__: ([#10367](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10367)) __'Fix multi-editing of gui node properties'__ by matgis
Fixed a regression where most Gui node properties would be hidden in the property editor when multiple Gui nodes were selected.

__FIX__: ([#10424](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10424)) __'Correctly apply Gui template rotation to imported nodes when building'__ by matgis
We were mistakenly mixing quaternion and Euler rotation math when baking Gui template node transforms into the imported nodes when building from the editor.
