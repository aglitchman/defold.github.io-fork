## Engine
__NEW__: ([#9636](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9636)) __'Remove unused world constant from tile_map in builtins'__ by FlexYourBrain
The unused `world` constant has been removed from the `tile_map` material from builtins.

__NEW__: ([#9644](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9644)) __'Automatically calculate the maximum number of game objects required for a runtime collection'__ by AGulev
Bob calculates how many game objects are used by each collection. If the collection has no `factory` or `collectionfactory` component, this value is used to allocate the exact number of GameObjects for the world (collection proxy). Otherwise, `collection.max_instances` is used.

This helps save memory, especially in cases where the game has a world that requires a large `max_instances` value for the main game scene, but smaller and static extra scenes (such as popups, menus, etc.).

__NEW__: ([#9649](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9649)) __'Add the `engine-setup` script tag to the HTML5 template'__ by aglitchman
This change brings back the `engine-setup` section to the HTML5 template. Developers can use it and native extensions can inject code here to add game startup parameters via the `CUSTOM_PARAMETERS` object, setup loading progress listeners, override the `dmloader.js` functions.

__NEW__: ([#9659](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9659)) __'Misc platform fixes for extensions'__ by Jhonnyg
A new DMSDK function has been added that can get the OpenGL id from a rendertarget: `OpenGLGetRenderTargetId`. Also, Vulkan support for iOS is working correctly again after recent GLFW changes.

__FIX__: ([#9671](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9671)) __'Added new property in `game.project` to specify minimum log level `project.minimum_log_level`'__ by AGulev
Using the new `game.project` property `project.minimum_log_level`, it is possible to specify the minimum log level for the logging system. Only logs at the minimum level or higher will be shown.

__FIX__: ([#9566](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9566)) __'Add alpha blending before rendering profiler'__ by Jhonnyg
Forced the in-game profiler to always be rendered with alpha blending.

__FIX__: ([#9499](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9499)) __'Added Switch Pro Controller for Windows'__ by wistpotion
Added Switch Pro Controller for Windows.

__FIX__: ([#9550](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9550)) __'Fix multi-materials in one skinning model'__ by jixingcn
Fixed an issue where custom vertex attributes are applied only from the first material in a situation where the same material is used across multiple material slots in a model file, but where each sub-material has overridden attributes.

In the .model file, the order of materials must be the same as in the original model file(.glb). (Notice: the defold editor will reorder all materials by name when you edit and save the model.)

__FIX__: ([#9563](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9563)) __'Only split combined samplers when needed'__ by Jhonnyg
Partial fix for #9533, the issue will still persist when building with WebGPU.

__FIX__: ([#9643](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9643)) __'Fix crash when MaxDynamicTextures == 0.'__ by ekharkunov
Setting dynamic textures to zero in GUIs no longer crashes the engine when running.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#9562](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9562)) __'Add a read-only property for the Current Node in the GUI.'__ by AGulev
Added a new read-only property `Current Nodes` for `GUI` to display the number of nodes currently being used in the GUI.

__NEW__: ([#9475](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9475)) __'Http cache improvements'__ by Jhonnyg
Several improvements to the HTTP support in the engine has been made:
* Restarting a project from the editor should be significantly faster for large projects
* HTTP requests via the `http.request` function for large files should also be significantly faster
* HEAD requests in the engine should be working correctly now - you can use a HEAD request to get the size of a remote file

__NEW__: ([#9610](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9610)) __'Add support for pivot points for atlases'__ by JCash
The images in an atlas now have support for a setting pivot point.
The pivot is defined in units, where (0,0) is top left corner of the image, and (1,1) is bottom right of the image.
The pivot is allowed to be outside of the [0, 1] range.
Default is (0.5, 0.5), which is the middle of the image.

__FIX__: ([#9559](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9559)) __'Fixed issue where the horizontal scroll bar was covering the last line in the console or the code editor'__ by AGulev
Fixed an issue where the horizontal scrollbar made it impossible to interact with the last line in the console or the code editor.

__FIX__: ([#9637](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9637)) __'Proper engine shutdown'__ by AGulev
Engine side fix for https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/9606

The engine shouldn't crash on De-init  if error happened during initialization
