Since the [beginning of the partnership](/2023/11/23/The-Defold-Foundation-partners-with-Poki/), the Defold Foundation and [Poki](https://developers.poki.com/) have been working on new features for the Defold engine specifically to boost performance on web. Last week we released the ability to bundle Defold games directly to Poki. This direct integration will not only make creating, but also testing and iterating on your Poki game much smoother. For Defold developers not working with Poki yet, you’ll now be able to create your own account and use Poki’s testing tools.

_We’re excited to deepen our collaboration with Defold and make it even easier for developers to build and share web games. Whether they already have a Poki account or not, they can now create a new game, upload a version, and start testing right away. We would like to meet developers where they are and support them with tools that fit naturally into their workflow. With this integration, we’re lowering the barrier to creation and continuing our commitment to open, accessible game development on the web._

#### Bundle for Poki
The first feature allows developers to bundle and upload their game directly into Poki for Developers. After clicking on ‘bundle for Poki’, your build will automatically ZIP and upload to Poki for Developers account, where you can user our testing tools for new games or update an existing game that is live on Poki. No more downloading and uploading ZIP files, everything is done with one click of a button.

For developers without an account with Poki, you’ll be redirected to the log in page where you can sign up and get access.

#### SDK Template
The SDK template includes the Poki SDK making it easy to create a game for Poki without having to deal with manually implementing the SDK. It is built specifically for HTML5 games so works like a charm for all things web and Poki. Just open a new project using the template and get going on your game without worrying about adding the SDK later.

_More and more developers are (re-)discovering the power of H5 games through web game platforms such as Poki. Thanks to our partnership, we can focus development efforts into the HTML5 version of the engine and offer our developers a great choice for publishing their web games using Defold and Poki. The new game template and the ability to upload directly to the dashboard makes it even easier for developers to get started with Poki and Defold game development!_
