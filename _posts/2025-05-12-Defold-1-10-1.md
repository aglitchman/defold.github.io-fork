## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#10454](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10454)) __'Throw a Lua error if `nil` passed into `go.delete()` function'__ by AGulev
⚠️ Passing `nil` to `go.delete()` results in a Lua error, as this aligns with expected behavior and helps catch logical issues in the code.

__NEW__: ([#10430](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10430)) __'Faster LU archive creation + Added option for compression level.  '__ by AGulev
A new option was added to the LiveUpdate settings: ZIP archive compression level, with levels ranging from 0 to 9.  
The default level is 1 (the same as before the changes).
This option is useful in cases where compression is not needed at all—e.g., when Poki repacks the archive and applies their own compression.  In such cases, using level 0 will significantly speed up archive creation and the bundling process.  
Additionally, the archive writer itself was improved, making archive creation at least twice as fast (regardless of whether compression is used or not).

On a test suite with 172,296 files, which were used for benchmarking on a Mac M1 Pro Max:  

- Archive creation before changes (level 1 compression): **56 seconds**  
- With performance improvements and default level 1 compression: **28 seconds**  
- With performance improvements and level 0 compression: **1.8 seconds**

__NEW__: ([#10442](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10442)) __'Added dynamic profiling scope for extensions'__ by britzl
Added per profiling scopes per extension update.

Example using profiler.dump_frame() shows the `Extension` scope and `WebView`, `LiveUpdate` and `Profiler` extensions:

__NEW__: ([#10464](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10464)) __'Resume HTML5 audio on "mouse down" and "touch start" events'__ by aglitchman
AudioContext now resumes on events ‘mouse down’ and ‘touch start’. Previously it was resuming on ‘mouse up’ and ‘touch end’ event and users hear the first sound with delay, i.e. only when they take their finger off the screen or mouse.

__NEW__: ([#9946](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9946)) __'Added API to get AABB for models.'__ by ekharkunov
Added new API to get AABB information from models:
* `model.get_aabb()`
* `model.get_mesh_aabb()`
AABB information return in form of table with two fields `min` and `max`. Both of them has type `vector3`.
Functions take 1 argument: url of the model component.

`model.get_aabb()` returns AABB information for the whole model in local coordinate space.
`model.get_mesh_aabb()` function returns a dictionary of AABB information for all meshes in the following form:
```
<hashed_mesh_id> = <aabb_information>
```

Usage example:
`model.get_aabb()`
```lua
model.get_aabb("#model") -> { min = vmath.vector3(-2.5, -3.0, 0), max = vmath.vector3(1.5, 5.5, 0) }
```

`model.get_mesh_aabb()`
```lua
model.get_mesh_aabb("#model") -> { hash("Sword") = { min = vmath.vector3(-0.5, -0.5, 0), max = vmath.vector3(0.5, 0.5, 0) }, hash("Shield") = { min = vmath.vector3(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5), max = vmath.vector3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) } }
```

__NEW__: ([#10554](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10554)) __'Added missing API docs to dmHashTable'__ by britzl
Added missing API documentation for `dmHashTable` constructor, `Clear`, `Capacity`, `Swap`, `Empty`, `Put`, `Erase` and `Iterate`.

__NEW__: ([#10555](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10555)) __'Added missing Gamepad API docs to dmHID'__ by britzl
Added API documentation for `GetGamepadPacket`, `GetGamepadButton` and `GetGamepadHat`.

__NEW__: ([#10576](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10576)) __'Add a fallback if globalThis is missing'__ by britzl
The global object (ie `globalThis`) is not set in old browsers and code in dmLoader.js etc rely on it being present. This change makes sure the `Window` object is set as `globalThis` according to [the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object).

__FIX__: ([#10307](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10307)) __'Added support for .opus sound format'__ by thengel01
We've added support for the [.opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)#:~:text=Opus%20is%20a%20lossy%20audio,complexity%20enough%20for%20low%2Dend) audio format.

It is a very effective compression, and is suitable for both music and sound effects.

As we are very conservative of the engine build size, we chose to add this support as an opt-in.
In order to add support for .opus files at runtime, you need to create an [App Manifest](https://defold.com/manuals/app-manifest/) and chose `Include Sound Decoder Opus`.

Similarly, it is now also possible to exclude the other decoders (.wav and .ogg) allowing you to slim down the engine size even further.

__FIX__: ([#10243](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10243)) __'Sound system mixer rework (down sampling enablement and general optimizations)'__ by thengel01
We've changed our sound resampler to support any sample rate.
The resampler now also supports SIMD code (SSE2 and wasm simd128) for better performance. It is currently enabled on platforms that support it , i.e. Windows, Linux, HTML5 and macOS (x64)

The change also reduces memory footprint than before.

__FIX__: ([#10394](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10394)) __'Fontc now uses the ttf font input to determine if it's monospaced'__ by JCash
Previously, it was determined based on the output, but if the output was a single glyph, it was always determined as monospaced.

__FIX__: ([#10544](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10544)) __'Make sure the engine picks the best GPU'__ by AGulev
GLFW for Windows is now built with `GLFW_USE_HYBRID_HPG` enabled to export the NvOptimusEnablement and AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance symbols, which force the use of the high-performance GPU on Nvidia Optimus and AMD PowerXpress systems.

__FIX__: ([#10462](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10462)) __'Use unique identifiers for factory-spawned game objects'__ by AGulev
All objects spawned with factories now have unique identifiers, which helps to avoid hidden issues

__FIX__: ([#10496](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10496)) __'Log error when vertex declaration doesn't match the vertex data in Vulkan'__ by JCash


__FIX__: ([#10541](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10541)) __'Use raw input for gamepads even if no gamepad is specified in the gamepad mappings'__ by AGulev
Games which use only raw gamepad data will now receive input events even if the gamepad bindings file is empty.

__FIX__: ([#10563](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10563)) __'Faster way to unpack tools in Bob'__ by AGulev
This change speeds up unpacking of external tools and makes their use thread safe when using more than one thread.

__FIX__: ([#10558](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10558)) __'Cleanup the input action table'__ by britzl
If a mouse is connected the input action table always contains mouse position data even for input actions which are not related to the mouse. This change cleans up the input action table so that only values relevant to the input action is included:

* Text Triggers will only include `text`
* Key Triggers will include `pressed`, `released`, `repeated` and `value`
* Mouse Triggers will include `pressed`, `released`, `repeated`, `value`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `screen_x`, screen_y`, `screen_dx` and `screen_dy`
* As always mouse movement is implicitly sent if a Mouse Trigger is set. It will include  `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `screen_x`, screen_y`, `screen_dx`, `screen_dy` and accelerometer data if on mobile
* Touch Triggers will include `pressed`, `released`, `repeated`, `value`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `screen_x`, screen_y`, `screen_dx`, `screen_dy` and `touch`
* Gamepad Triggers will include `pressed`, `released`, `repeated`, `value`, `gamepad`


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#10378](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10378)) __'Auto-insert closing parens in the code editor'__ by vlaaad
![record](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b73fe7c3-6612-462f-a52d-38f90cc0494a)

__NEW__: ([#10380](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10380)) __'Add build server username/password prefs fields'__ by vlaaad
This changeset also adds a new prefs schema type in editor scripts: password, e.g.
```lua
function M.get_prefs_schema()
    return {["my-extension.third-party-api-key"] = editor.prefs.schema.password()}
end
```
Password schema behaves as a string schema, but the value is encrypted in the prefs file.

__NEW__: ([#10433](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10433)) __'Introduce global console filtering toggle '__ by sprocketc
A global filter toggle button was introduced to the console tab.

![Screenshot From 2025-04-04 18-10-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd4110ac-7f3a-4d55-8389-204c913b2f3a)

__NEW__: ([#10490](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10490)) __'Do not autocomplete Lua code in comments'__ by AGulev

__NEW__: ([#10494](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10494)) __'Add Project and Debug locations for editor script commands'__ by vlaaad
Now this editor script will work:
```lua
local M = {}

function M.get_commands()
    return {
        {
            label = "Project command",
            locations = {"Project"},
            run = function()
                print("Run project command")
            end
        },
        {
            label = "Debug command",
            locations = {"Debug"},
            run = function()
                print("Run debug command")
            end
        }
    }
end

return M
```

__NEW__: ([#10505](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10505)) __'Option to hide the Changed File panel'__ by AGulev
New option `View -> Toggle Changed Files Pane` that hides the `Changed Files` panel.

__NEW__: ([#10512](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/10512)) __'Add editor shortcut keymap configuration'__ by vlaaad
We added the Keymap tab to the Preferences dialog — now it's possible to configure editor command shortcuts from within the editor:
![record](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5ee9d18-3b3c-4655-a78e-e2c8a910be94)

Assigning shortcuts to commands defined in editor scripts is now also possible. If a command defines an id, it will appear in the Keymap configuration table. Example editor script:
```lua
local M = {}
function M.get_commands()
  return {
    editor.command({
      label = "Print Git Status",
      locations = {"Project"},
      id = "vcs.print-git-status",
      run = function(opts)
        editor.execute("git", "status", {reload_resources=false})
      end
    })
  }
end
return M
```
Now you can assign a shortcut:
