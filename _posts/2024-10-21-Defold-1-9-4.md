## Engine
__NEW__: ([#9474](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9474)) __The physics contact_point_event now returns the correct contact point__ 
This is a bug fix for the `contact_point_event`, where the `position` is now the contact point itself.
This makes it similar to the `contact_point_response` event, which was the intention.

If you need the old position (the world position of the object itself), you can use either `message.a.instance_position`/`message.b.instance_position`.

__NEW__: ([#9413](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9413)) __Upgrade emscripten to 3.1.65__ 
Emscripten has been updated to 3.1.65 from 3.1.55. This is a prerequisite for the coming WebGPU support

__NEW__: ([#9383](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9383)) __Start work on WebGPU adapter__ 
WebGPU has been added as an experimental graphics backend for web platforms. To test WebGPU, run bob.jar with the following commands in the project folder of your project:

`java -jar path-to-latest-bob.jar build bundle --archive --platform=js-web --debug-output-wgsl=true`

Note that this is a `technical preview` of our WebGPU support, and some things are not yet implemented. It is not recommended to publish an application yet that uses this backend, but it _is_ encouraged to try it out!

__NEW__: ([#9438](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9438)) __New vmath functions__ 
Added new `vmath` functions:
* `vmath.quat_matrix4` - get quaternion from matrix4
* `vmath.matrix4_compose` - create matrix4 from translation (vector3|vector4), rotation (quaternion) and scale (vector3)
* `vmath.matrix4_scale` - create matrix4 from scale (vector3) or from number (uniform scale) or 3 number (x, y, z)
* `vmath.clamp` - clamp input value in range [min, max]. Input value can be number, vector, vector3, vector4. In case of vector type clamp applies per vector component. `min`, `max` also can be number, vector, vector3, vector4.

__NEW__: ([#9441](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9441)) __Added a font name to the .glyph_bank generated name__ 
The `.glyph_bank` filename now includes the name of the font used for glyph bank generation.

__NEW__: ([#9450](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9450)) __Add configurable options for emscripten compiler.__ 
Add options to application manifest to control stack size (`stackSize`)/overall memory size (`initialMemory`)/minimum supported browser versions (`minSafariVersion`/`minChromeVersion`/`minFirefoxVersion`). In some cases it can help to reduce binary size because Emscripten doesn't apply code-generation for supporting old browsers.

__NEW__: ([#8743](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8743)) __Instancing support for models__ 
Model components can now use hardware instancing! This means that models that share the same mesh but has its own transform and normal matrices can now be rendered with a single draw call instead of individual draw calls. This is useful for repeated geometry, such as trees, foliage, static props such as trash cans, boxes or even complete buildings. 

The simplest route to start using instancing is to add an attribute in the vertex shader that holds the `world matrix`, or a `normal matrix`:

```glsl
attribute mat4 mtx_world;
attribute mat4 mtx_normal;
```

When any attribute is marked as an instanced attribute, instanced draw calls will automatically be created. This also works for custom vertex attributes. Here's an example of using an custom instanced attribute for storing an individual tint attribute per model:

<img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7ff540d-7930-495c-8b24-cd40b7fa9881">

The color attribute in this case has its `vertex step function` marked as `instance` in the material, which means that this attribute will be repeated per instance instead of per vertex:

<img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c8a65f-5b6a-4d41-8357-672ad21ac202">

This enables us to draw all boxes with just one draw call instead of 4, even with custom vertex data per model!

To read more about instancing in Defold, please consult the [Manual entry](https://defold.com/manuals/material/#instancing).

A simple example that shows how to use the new functionality is available here:

__FIX__: ([#464](https://github.com/defold/extender/pull/464)) __Fix issues building certain combinations of pod dependencies__ 
This issue fixes issues when building for instance the Yandex SDK


Fixes #389

__FIX__: ([#9414](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9414)) __Added dmUtf8 to dmSDK__ 
This allows native extensions to easily convert utf8 strings into codepoints, for use with e.g. font generation.
The header file is located at `<dmsdk/dlib/utf8.h>`

__FIX__: ([#9477](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9477)) __Added `android:appCategory="game"` into `AndroidManifest.xml`__ 
Google Play requires the `android:appCategory` attribute in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. Since Defold is a game engine, we have added `android:appCategory="game"` into the default `AndroidManifest.xml`.

If you need a different category for your app, create a custom manifest and choose the appropriate category: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#appCategory.

> [!WARNING]
> If you already have a custom `AndroidManifest.xml`, please take note of these changes.

__FIX__: ([#9483](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9483)) __Fix the build report in JSON format.__ 
Fix the issue where the build report in JSON format is not being generated.

__FIX__: ([#9487](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9487)) __Updated zlib to 1.3.1.1__ 


__FIX__: ([#9511](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9511)) __Fix editor-related build scripts on windows__ 
When running on Windows (MinGW), invoking `run.command` didn't forward the env variables to the program. Previously, we had a code that did `env JAVA_CMD=.../bin/java bash ./scripts/lein ...`, and I removed it in favor of using the `env = lein_env` kwarg without knowing about the implications for Windows. Restoring.

__FIX__: ([#9532](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9532)) __Fix for double destroying the timer callback__ 
In rare cases, the timer callback was destroyed twice, causing a crash


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#9415](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9415)) __Added font glyph api to dmSDK__ 
We've added a api to our dmSDK for manipulating font resources.
This allows for writing extensions such as [extension-font](https://github.com/defold/extension-font), making it possible to avoid storing large amounts of pre rendered glyph images in the default game, and instead generate them at runtime.

The api has been added to `dmsdk/gamesys/resources/res_font.h`.

```c++
#include <dmsdk/gamesys/resources/res_font.h>

dmRender::HFont    dmGameSystem::ResFontGetHandle(FontResource* font);
dmResource::Result dmGameSystem::ResFontGetInfo(FontResource* font, FontInfo* info);
dmResource::Result dmGameSystem::ResFontGetCacheCellInfo(FontResource* font, uint32_t* width, uint32_t* height, uint32_t* max_ascent);
bool               dmGameSystem::ResFontHasGlyph(FontResource* font, uint32_t codepoint);
dmResource::Result dmGameSystem::ResFontAddGlyph(FontResource* font, uint32_t codepoint, FontGlyph* glyph, void* imagedata, uint32_t imagedatasize);
dmResource::Result dmGameSystem::ResFontRemoveGlyph(FontResource* font, uint32_t codepoint);
```

__NEW__: ([#9388](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9388)) __Improved `Debug->Simulate Resolution` functionality__ 
A few improvements were made to the `Debug->Simulate Resolution` functionality in the editor:
* The selected resolution is now saved for a project, including custom resolutions.
* The selected resolution is applied every time the engine starts.
* A few new iPhone devices and a new "Handheld" section were added.
* Resolution simulation now works for all launched instances.

__NEW__: ([#9393](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9393)) __Show logs from a selected target in the editor's console__ 
When a remote target is selected, the editor tries to connect to the target's log service to display them in the console.

__NEW__: ([#9440](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9440)) __Build only the WASM version of the engine when running `Build HTML5`__ 
Building two versions of the engine can take a long time, and considering that WASM is supported by 100% of modern browsers, it doesnât make sense to build both versions every time a developer wants to test a game. 
From now on, `Build HTML5` will build only the `wasm` version of the engine.

__FIX__: ([#9419](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9419)) __Retain gui overrides if the template gui scene is modified externally__ 
Fixed an issue where gui node property overrides would be lost from referencing `.gui` files if the referenced template `.gui` file was modified by an external process.

__FIX__: ([#9426](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9426)) __Fix the issue where the hash script property can't be reversed__ 
Hash values can be reversed to their string equivalents in Debug builds, simplifying the development process. This fix makes hashes added in `go.property()` reversible as well.

__FIX__: ([#9425](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9425)) __Fix text sync with language servers__ 


__FIX__: ([#9429](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9429)) __Better handling of errors in tilemaps when the tilesource is broken.__ 
If a tilemap uses a tilesource without a texture, it's impossible to show the palette, which previously resulted in an error.

__FIX__: ([#9444](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9444)) __Fix the detection of `require` in a tail function call by the editor.__ 
Fixed an issue where using a tail call with `require` was impossible in the editor:
```lua
local result = require("my_module").call(42)
```

__FIX__: ([#9510](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9510)) __Make the building artifacts independent for the `Build HTML5` and `Build` options__ 
From now on, the `Build HTML5` and `Build` options produce separate build artifact folders in the `build` directory. This means alternating between these options will no longer require rebuilding the project from scratch each time, speeding up the workflow for HTML5 testing.

__NEW__: ([#9531](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/9531)) Add `editor.bob()` function to editor scripts

Now you can perform [bob](https://defold.com/manuals/bob/) tasks using editor scripts. Some examples:
1. Print help in the console:
   ```lua
   editor.bob({help = true})
   ```
2. Bundle the game for the host platform:
   ```lua
   local opts = {
       archive = true,
       platform = editor.platform
   }
   editor.bob(opts, "distclean", "resolve", "build", "bundle")
   ```
3. Use a custom build server and extra settings files for overriding `game.project` settings:
   ```lua
   local opts = {
       archive = true,
       platform = editor.platform,
       build_server = "https://build.my-company.com",
       settings = {"test.ini", "headless.ini"}
   }
   editor.bob(opts, "distclean", "resolve", "build")
   ```
